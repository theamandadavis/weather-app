// Write an HTTP server that serves the forecasted weather. Your server should expose an endpoint that:
// 1.     Accepts latitude and longitude coordinates
// 2.     Returns the short forecast for that area for Today (“Partly Cloudy” etc)
// 3.     Returns a characterization of whether the temperature is “hot”, “cold”, or “moderate” (use your discretion on mapping temperatures to each type)
// 4.     Use the National Weather Service API Web Service as a data source.
// The purpose of this exercise is to provide a sample of your work that we can discuss together in the Technical Interview.
// •         We respect your time. Spend as long as you need, but we intend it to take around an hour.
// •         We do not expect a production-ready service, but you might want to comment on your shortcuts.
// •         The submitted project should build and have brief instructions so we can verify that it works.
// •         The Coding Project should be written in the language for the job you’re applying for. (golang)
